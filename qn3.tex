\section{Question 3}

In this section, question 3 is discussed.

I was unable to complete this question, however I am describing my approach to it below:

\subsection{3 (a)}
> Since the likelihood is to be written for a distribution that has positive, countable, discrete samples, we can write down the maximum likelihood using a poisson distribution.

> The log likelihood can be written as:
 $$ -\ln{L(p)} = -\sum\limits_{i=0}^{N-1} {(y_i \ln{\mu(x_i/\mathbf{p})} - \mu(x_i/\mathbf{p})- \ln{y_i!} )} $$
Where $x_i$ can be gotten from checking the range of the radii in the respective mass-bin files. Corresponding y_i for the model is drawn form random realizations of the distribution n(x) in equation.2, by using random values of a, b, c generated in the specified range in question 2(a). (Values of A at these points are found using the 3D interpolator written for question 2(h)). 
$\mathbf{p}$ is the vector containing the parameters (a,b,c) of the data.

> To find the (a,b,c) that maximize this likelihood, the above log likelihood equation is differentiated and equated to zero. 
 
 \subsection{3 b)}
If the values of (a,b,c) have significant number of outliers, robust fitting would be suitable, since interpolation would wrongly estimate the shape of the function.
